# StellarYield — Soroban Smart Contracts

StellarYield is a Real World Asset (RWA) yield platform built natively on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts. It enables compliant, on-chain investment in tokenised real-world assets — such as Treasury Bills, corporate bonds, and real estate funds — with per-epoch yield distribution and full lifecycle management.

---

## Overview

The protocol is composed of two contracts:

### `single_rwa_vault`

Each deployed instance of this contract represents **one specific RWA investment**. Users deposit a stable asset (e.g. USDC) and receive vault shares proportional to their stake. The contract:

- Issues **SEP-41-compliant fungible share tokens** representing a user's position
- Enforces **zkMe KYC verification** before allowing deposits
- Tracks a **vault lifecycle**: `Funding → Active → Matured`
- Distributes **yield per epoch** — operators inject yield into the vault and users claim their share proportionally based on their share balance at the time of each epoch
- Supports **early redemption** via an operator-approved request flow with a configurable exit fee
- Allows **full redemption at maturity**, automatically settling any unclaimed yield
- Includes **per-user deposit limits** and an **emergency pause / withdraw** mechanism

### `vault_factory`

A registry and deployment factory for `single_rwa_vault` instances. It:

- Stores the `single_rwa_vault` WASM hash and deploys new vault contracts on demand using `e.deployer()`
- Maintains an on-chain registry of all deployed vaults with their metadata
- Supports **batch vault creation** in a single transaction
- Manages a shared set of **default configuration** values (asset, zkMe verifier, cooperator) inherited by every new vault
- Provides **admin and operator role management**

## Workspace layout

The Cargo workspace root is the **repository root** (`Cargo.toml` next to `soroban-contracts/`). From the clone root you can run:

```bash
cargo test -p vault_factory
```

## Architecture

```
VaultFactory
    ├── deploys ──▶ SingleRWA_Vault  (Treasury Bill A)
    ├── deploys ──▶ SingleRWA_Vault  (Corporate Bond B)
    └── deploys ──▶ SingleRWA_Vault  (Real Estate Fund C)
```

Each vault is an independent contract with its own share token, yield ledger, and lifecycle state. The factory only handles deployment and registration — it has no authority over a vault's funds once deployed.

---

## Vault lifecycle

```
Funding ──▶ Active ──▶ Matured ──▶ Closed
```

| State     | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Funding` | Accepting deposits until the funding target is reached       |
| `Active`  | RWA investment is live; operators distribute yield per epoch |
| `Matured` | Maturity date reached; users redeem principal + yield        |
| `Closed`  | Terminal state; all shares redeemed and vault wound down     |

---

## Yield distribution model

Yield is distributed in discrete **epochs**. When an operator calls `distribute_yield`, the contract:

1. Pulls the yield amount from the operator into the vault
2. Records the epoch's total yield and the total share supply at that point in time
3. Snapshots each user's share balance lazily (on their next interaction)

A user's claimable yield for epoch `n` is:

$$\text{yield}_{\text{user}} = \frac{\text{shares}_{\text{user at epoch } n}}{\text{total shares at epoch } n} \times \text{epoch yield}_n$$

---

## Units and precision

The protocol distinguishes between two primary unit types to ensure clear accounting between the underlying RWA investment and the vault representation.

| Unit Type | Token | Description | Sample Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assets** | Underlying (e.g. USDC) | The base investment currency. All "deposit" and "yield" inputs are in **Asset** units. | `deposit(10_000_000)` = 10 USDC |
| **Shares** | Vault (e.g. syBOND) | The token representing ownership. All "mint" and "redeem" inputs are in **Share** units. | `redeem(5_000_000)` = 5 shares |

### Integer Math and Decimals

All values transferred or stored are **integers**. The protocol does not use floating-point math.
- **Asset Units**: If USDC has 6 decimals, `1,000,000` on-chain units equals 1.00 USDC.
- **Share Units**: The vault typically matches the asset decimals for a 1:1 initial parity.
- **Basis Points (BPS)**: Fees (e.g. `early_redemption_fee_bps`) and APY use basis points where `10,000 BPS = 100%`.

---

## Storage design

The protocol follows Stellar best practices for storage tiering to balance cost and durability.

| Storage tier   | Description                               | TTL Behavior                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance**   | Global config, vault state, counters.     | Shared lifetime; bumped by contract logic.      |
| **Persistent** | Per-user balances, allowances, snapshots. | Per-entry lifetime; bumped on user interaction. |

### Storage key map (DataKey)

| Key                         | Tier       | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Admin`                     | Instance   | Primary contract administrator address.                             |
| `Asset`                     | Instance   | Underlying stable asset address (e.g. USDC).                        |
| `VaultSt`                   | Instance   | Current lifecycle state (`Funding`, `Active`, `Matured`, `Closed`). |
| `TotSup`                    | Instance   | Total supply of vault shares.                                       |
| `TotDep`                    | Instance   | Total deposited principal (excluding yield).                        |
| `CurEpoch`                  | Instance   | Current epoch counter.                                              |
| `Balance(Addr)`             | Persistent | User share balance.                                                 |
| `Allowance(Owner, Spender)` | Persistent | User share allowance (with expiry).                                 |
| `UsrDep(Addr)`              | Persistent | Total principal deposited by a specific user.                       |
| `EpYield(u32)`              | Instance   | Total yield distributed in a specific epoch.                        |
| `EpTotShr(u32)`             | Instance   | Total share supply snapshotted at epoch distribution.               |
| `Role(Addr, Role)`          | Instance   | Granular RBAC role assignment.                                      |
| `Blacklst(Addr)`            | Persistent | Compliance blacklist status.                                        |

## Deploy

### Interactive testnet deployment

Three shell scripts in `scripts/` cover the full deployment workflow.
They prompt for required parameters and save state to `soroban-contracts/.env.testnet`
so each subsequent step can pick up where the last left off.

```bash
# Step 1 — deploy the factory (uploads vault WASM, deploys VaultFactory)
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# or via make (runs the same script)
cd soroban-contracts && make deploy-testnet
```

```bash
# Step 2 — create a vault through the factory
./scripts/create-vault.sh

# or via make
cd soroban-contracts && make deploy-vault
```

```bash
# Step 3 — deposit test tokens into a vault
./scripts/fund-vault.sh
```

Each script accepts the same parameters as environment variables, allowing
non-interactive use in CI:

```bash
FACTORY_ADDRESS=C... \
OPERATOR_ADDRESS=G... \
ASSET=C... \
VAULT_NAME="US Treasury 6-Month Bill" \
VAULT_SYMBOL=syUSTB \
RWA_NAME="US Treasury 6-Month Bill" \
RWA_SYMBOL=USTB6M \
RWA_DOCUMENT_URI="ipfs://bafybei..." \
MATURITY_DATE=1780000000 \
./scripts/create-vault.sh --non-interactive
```

### Manual deployment (raw CLI)

```bash
# 1. Upload the SingleRWA_Vault WASM and capture its hash
VAULT_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/single_rwa_vault.wasm \
  --source-account <YOUR_KEY> \
  --network testnet)

# 2. Deploy the VaultFactory
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/vault_factory.wasm \
  --source-account <YOUR_KEY> \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  --admin        <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --default_asset  <USDC_ADDRESS> \
  --zkme_verifier  <ZKME_ADDRESS> \
  --cooperator     <COOPERATOR_ADDRESS> \
  --vault_wasm_hash "$VAULT_HASH"

# 3. Create a vault through the factory
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <FACTORY_ADDRESS> \
  --source-account <YOUR_KEY> \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_single_rwa_vault \
  --caller      <OPERATOR_ADDRESS> \
  --asset       <USDC_ADDRESS> \
  --name        "US Treasury 6-Month Bill" \
  --symbol      "syUSTB" \
  --rwa_name    "US Treasury 6-Month Bill" \
  --rwa_symbol  "USTB6M" \
  --rwa_document_uri "ipfs://..." \
  --maturity_date 1780000000
```

## Error catalog

This section documents all error codes returned by the contracts. Integrators can use these codes to display actionable error messages to users.

## Events reference

### Event name to trigger function mapping

Each contract operation emits specific events to enable off-chain monitoring and indexing. The table below maps event names (topic symbols) to the functions that trigger them.

| Event Symbol | Event Name               | Trigger Function(s)                                                                            | Description                                       |

### Event payload semantics

- `set_cooperator` emits `coop_upd` with data tuple `(old_cooperator, new_cooperator)`.
- `set_zkme_verifier` emits `zkme_upd` with topics `(symbol, caller)` and data `(old_verifier, new_verifier)`.
- Both events are emitted after authorization and input validation, and are intended for compliance/audit indexers.

### Yield claiming examples

#### Example: Claim all pending yield

The `claim_yield` function claims all unclaimed yield across all epochs in a single transaction. This is the most gas-efficient approach for users who claim infrequently.

```rust
// User claims all pending yield from epochs 1-5
vault.claim_yield(&user);
// Emits: yield_clm event with total amount and current epoch
```

**When to use:**

- User wants to claim all available yield at once
- Simplest integration for wallets and frontends
- Most gas-efficient for users who claim periodically

**Event emitted:**

```
Topic: ("yield_clm", user_address)
Data: (total_amount_claimed, current_epoch)
```

**Sample Scenario (6 decimals):**
- **Distribute**: Operator calls `distribute_yield(10_000_000)` (10 USDC, Epoch 1).
  - Emits `yield_dis` event: Topic `("yield_dis", 1)`, Data `(10000000, 1714300000)`.
- **Claim**: User calls `claim_yield`.
  - Emits `yield_clm` event: Topic `("yield_clm", user_address)`, Data `(10000000, 1)`.

#### Example: Claim yield for a specific epoch

The `claim_yield_for_epoch` function allows granular claiming of yield from individual epochs. This enables partial claims and supports vesting schedules.

```rust
// User claims only epoch 3 yield
vault.claim_yield_for_epoch(&user, &3u32);
// Emits: yield_clm event with epoch 3 amount

// Later, user claims epoch 5 yield
vault.claim_yield_for_epoch(&user, &5u32);
// Emits: yield_clm event with epoch 5 amount
```

**When to use:**

- Yield has a vesting period and user wants to claim vested portions incrementally
- User wants to defer tax events by claiming specific epochs
- Advanced integrations that need epoch-level control
- Testing and debugging yield calculations

**Event emitted:**

```
Topic: ("yield_clm", user_address)
Data: (epoch_amount_claimed, epoch_number)
```

**Sample Scenario (6 decimals):**
- **Distribute**: Operator calls `distribute_yield(5_000_000)` (5 USDC, Epoch 5).
  - Emits `yield_dis` event: Topic `("yield_dis", 5)`, Data `(5000000, 1714300500)`.
- **Claim**: User calls `claim_yield_for_epoch(user, 5)`.
  - Emits `yield_clm` event: Topic `("yield_clm", user_address)`, Data `(5000000, 5)`.

**Vesting example:**

If yield has a 30-day vesting period, users can claim the vested portion of each epoch as it becomes available:

```rust
// Day 1: Epoch 1 distributed with 10,000 yield
vault.distribute_yield(&operator, 10_000);

// Day 15: 50% vested, user claims half
let claimed = vault.claim_yield_for_epoch(&user, &1u32);
// claimed = 5,000 (50% of user's share)

// Day 31: Fully vested, user claims remainder
let claimed = vault.claim_yield_for_epoch(&user, &1u32);
// claimed = 5,000 (remaining 50%)
```

### Gas and resource considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `claim_yield` and `pending_yield` iterate linearly through epochs starting from the user's `last_claimed_epoch`. 
> 
> In vaults with frequent distributions (e.g., daily) and high user inactivity, a single claim transaction may encompass hundreds of epochs, potentially exceeding Soroban gas or transaction size limits.
> 
> **Recommendations for integrators:**
> 1. **Batch Claiming**: If a full `claim_yield` fails, use `claim_yield_for_epoch` to claim chunks of epochs (e.g., 50 at a time).
> 2. **Polling**: Use `pending_yield_breakdown(user, max_epochs)` to fetch a paginated view of unclaimed epochs (capped at 50 per call) to populate UI dashboards without hitting limits.

## VaultState transition diagram

The vault progresses through a defined lifecycle with specific state transitions. Some transitions are operator-controlled, while others are automatic based on conditions. Understanding these states is critical for integrators building user interfaces and operators managing vault lifecycles.

### Detailed state transition rules

#### 1. Funding → Active

**Trigger:** Operator calls `activate_vault()`

**Pre-conditions:**

- `total_deposited >= funding_target` (funding target must be met)
- Current state must be `Funding`
- Caller must have `LifecycleManager` or `FullOperator` role

**Effects:**

- Vault state changes to `Active`
- Yield distribution becomes enabled
- Early redemption requests become possible
- Emits `VaultStateChanged` event

**Example:**

```rust
// Check if funding target is met
let is_met = vault.is_funding_target_met();
if is_met {
    vault.activate_vault(&operator);
    // State is now Active
}
```

#### 2. Funding → Cancelled

**Trigger:** Operator/admin calls `cancel_funding()`

**Pre-conditions:**

- `current_timestamp > funding_deadline` (deadline must have passed)
- `total_deposited < funding_target` (target not met)
- Current state must be `Funding`
- Caller must have `LifecycleManager` or `FullOperator` role or be admin

**Effects:**

- Vault state changes to `Cancelled`
- Users can call `refund()` to reclaim their principal
- All deposits are returned 1:1 (no yield, no fees)
- Emits `FundingCancelled` event

**Example:**

```rust
// After funding deadline passes without meeting target
vault.cancel_funding(&operator);
// Users can now call refund()
vault.refund(&user); // Returns deposited assets
```

#### 3. Active → Matured

**Trigger:** Operator calls `mature_vault()`

**Pre-conditions:**

- `current_timestamp >= maturity_date` (maturity date reached)
- Current state must be `Active`
- Caller must have `LifecycleManager` or `FullOperator` role

**Effects:**

- Vault state changes to `Matured`
- `redeem_at_maturity()` becomes available (auto-claims yield)
- New deposits are blocked
- Yield distribution is blocked (no new epochs)
- Existing yield can still be claimed
- Emits `VaultStateChanged` event

**Example:**

```rust
// After maturity date is reached
vault.mature_vault(&operator);
// Users can now redeem with auto-yield claim
vault.redeem_at_maturity(&user, shares, &user);
```

#### 4. Matured → Closed

**Trigger:** Operator/admin calls `close_vault()`

**Pre-conditions:**

- `total_supply == 0` (all shares must be redeemed)
- Current state must be `Matured`
- Caller must have `LifecycleManager` or `FullOperator` role or be admin

**Effects:**

- Vault state changes to `Closed` (terminal)
- All operations blocked except read-only queries
- Vault is permanently wound down
- Emits `VaultStateChanged` event

**Example:**

```rust
// After all users have redeemed
if vault.total_supply() == 0 {
    vault.close_vault(&operator);
    // Vault is now permanently closed
}
```

#### 5. Cancelled → Closed

**Trigger:** Automatic when conditions are met

**Pre-conditions:**

- `total_supply == 0` (all shares refunded)
- Current state is `Cancelled`

**Effects:**

- Vault automatically transitions to `Closed`
- No explicit function call needed
- Terminal state reached

**Example:**

```rust
// After all users refund their shares
vault.refund(&user1);
vault.refund(&user2);
// ... all users refund
// Vault automatically becomes Closed when total_supply reaches 0
```

#### 6. Any → Emergency

**Trigger:** Admin or multi-sig calls `emergency_enable_pro_rata()`

**Pre-conditions:**

- Caller must be admin OR multi-sig threshold met
- Crisis scenario (e.g., RWA default, regulatory action, smart contract vulnerability)

**Effects:**

- Vault state changes to `Emergency` (terminal)
- All normal operations cease
- Users can call `emergency_claim()` once to receive pro-rata share of remaining assets
- Formula: `user_claim = (user_shares / total_supply) × vault_balance`
- Emits `EmergencyModeEnabled` event

**Example:**

```rust
// In crisis scenario
vault.emergency_enable_pro_rata(&admin);
// Users claim their pro-rata share
let amount = vault.emergency_claim(&user);
// Each user can only claim once
```

### State guards and error handling

The contract enforces state transitions through guard functions that panic with specific errors when called in invalid states:

#### Guard functions

```rust
// Requires vault to be in Funding or Active state
require_active_or_funding(e);
// Used by: deposit, mint

// Requires vault to be in Active or Matured state
require_active_or_matured(e);
// Used by: claim_yield, claim_yield_for_epoch, withdraw, redeem

// Requires vault to be in a specific state
require_state(e, VaultState::Matured);
// Used by: redeem_at_maturity

// Requires vault to NOT be in Closed state
require_not_closed(e);
// Used by: most state-modifying operations

// Requires vault to be in Emergency state
require_state(e, VaultState::Emergency);
// Used by: emergency_claim
```

#### Error codes

| Error Code | Error Name                 | Trigger Condition                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 5          | `InvalidVaultState`        | Operation not allowed in current vault state   |
| 8          | `NotMatured`               | Operation requires Matured state               |
| 10         | `FundingTargetNotMet`      | Cannot activate without meeting funding target |
| 16         | `FundingDeadlinePassed`    | Funding deadline expired                       |
| 17         | `FundingDeadlineNotPassed` | Deadline not yet reached for cancellation      |
| 27         | `VaultNotEmpty`            | Cannot close vault with outstanding shares     |
| 29         | `NotInEmergency`           | Operation requires Emergency state             |

### State-specific behavior examples

#### Funding state example

```rust
// Vault just deployed, in Funding state
let vault = deploy_vault(&env, params);

// Users can deposit
vault.deposit(&user1, 100_000, &user1); // ✅ Allowed

// Cannot distribute yield yet
vault.distribute_yield(&operator, 5_000); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState

// Cannot claim yield
vault.claim_yield(&user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState

// Can transfer shares
vault.transfer(&user1, &user2, 1_000); // ✅ Allowed
```

#### Active state example

```rust
// Vault activated after meeting funding target
vault.activate_vault(&operator);

// All operations available
vault.deposit(&user1, 50_000, &user1); // ✅ Allowed
vault.distribute_yield(&operator, 5_000); // ✅ Allowed
vault.claim_yield(&user1); // ✅ Allowed
vault.withdraw(&user1, 10_000, &user1); // ✅ Allowed
vault.request_early_redemption(&user1, 1_000); // ✅ Allowed

// Cannot use maturity-specific functions
vault.redeem_at_maturity(&user1, 1_000, &user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
```

#### Matured state example

```rust
// Vault matured after reaching maturity date
vault.mature_vault(&operator);

// Can redeem with auto-yield claim
vault.redeem_at_maturity(&user1, shares, &user1); // ✅ Allowed

// Can still claim unclaimed yield
vault.claim_yield(&user1); // ✅ Allowed

// Cannot deposit anymore
vault.deposit(&user1, 10_000, &user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState

// Cannot distribute new yield
vault.distribute_yield(&operator, 5_000); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
```

#### Cancelled state example

```rust
// Funding cancelled after deadline without meeting target
vault.cancel_funding(&operator);

// Users can only refund
vault.refund(&user1); // ✅ Allowed - returns deposited principal

// All other operations blocked
vault.deposit(&user1, 10_000, &user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
vault.claim_yield(&user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
```

#### Emergency state example

```rust
// Emergency mode activated
vault.emergency_enable_pro_rata(&admin);

// Users can claim pro-rata share once
let amount = vault.emergency_claim(&user1); // ✅ Allowed (once)
vault.emergency_claim(&user1); // ❌ Panics: AlreadyClaimedEmergency

// All normal operations blocked
vault.deposit(&user1, 10_000, &user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
vault.claim_yield(&user1); // ❌ Panics: InvalidVaultState
```

### Integration guidelines

#### For frontend developers

1. **Always check current state** before rendering UI:

   ```typescript
   const state = await vault.vaultState();
   if (state === VaultState.Funding) {
     // Show deposit UI
   } else if (state === VaultState.Active) {
     // Show deposit, withdraw, claim yield UI
   } else if (state === VaultState.Matured) {
     // Show redeem at maturity UI
   }
   ```

2. **Handle state transition events**:
   - Subscribe to `VaultStateChanged` events
   - Update UI when state changes
   - Disable unavailable operations

3. **Show appropriate messaging**:
   - Funding: "Vault is raising capital"
   - Active: "Investment is live, earning yield"
   - Matured: "Investment matured, redeem your shares"
   - Cancelled: "Funding cancelled, claim your refund"
   - Closed: "Vault is closed"
   - Emergency: "Emergency mode, claim your pro-rata share"

#### For operators

1. **Funding phase checklist**:
   - Monitor `funding_progress_bps()` to track progress
   - Check `is_funding_target_met()` before activating
   - If deadline approaches without meeting target, prepare to call `cancel_funding()`

2. **Active phase operations**:
   - Call `distribute_yield()` at regular intervals (e.g., monthly)
   - Process early redemption requests via `process_early_redemption()`
   - Monitor vault health and yield performance

3. **Maturity transition**:
   - Call `mature_vault()` after `maturity_date` is reached
   - Communicate to users that full redemptions are available
   - Monitor `total_supply` to know when vault can be closed

4. **Closing the vault**:
   - Ensure `total_supply == 0` before calling `close_vault()`
   - Verify all yield has been distributed and claimed
   - Archive vault data for compliance

#### For auditors

Key invariants to verify:

1. **State transition monotonicity**: States generally progress forward (except Emergency which can be triggered from any state)
2. **Terminal states**: `Closed` and `Emergency` cannot transition to other states
3. **Operation authorization**: State-modifying operations require appropriate roles
4. **Asset conservation**: Total assets = deposits + yield - withdrawals - fees
5. **Share accounting**: Total supply matches sum of all user balances
